   return the stack (inside an Option)
   if the character is a closing bracket, then pop the top of the stack, and
   check the popped character matches. If it does, then return the new stack,
   otherwise return None (to indicate matching failure). *)

(* The fold loops over the characters of s, repeatedly calling update on a stack
   and each character of s.
   If update ever encounters a non-matching bracket, it returns None, and the
   fold will as well.
   Otherwise, the fold will return a stack after going through all of the string.
   If the stack is non-empty, then some non-matching brackets must remain, so the string
   is not balanced.
   If the stack is empty, everything matches, and the string balances.
