Menhir is a parser generator which you can use to solve this exercise. 
There is documentation in the [Real World OCaml book](https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/parsing-with-ocamllex-and-menhir.html).

Note that Menhir is not installed by default, but you can get it via opam:

```opam install menhir```

Alternatively, you can simply write the parsing code yourself, or find
another parsing library in OCaml.
